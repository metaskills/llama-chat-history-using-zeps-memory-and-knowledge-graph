**Profile**  
Early on as a Marketing Director, I was a self-described "conversion junkie". Today, I apply that same passion to the entire organization, bringing technology and innovative thinking to broad business problems using the same measurable results. Empathy and strategy are my superpowers that connect "hello world" to "hello revenue" using years of experience in Product, E-commerce, Engineering, Infrastructure, Marketing, Sales, and now applied AI features and automation.
